Creating a web site using razor pages is different from creating creating creating a web api

In website using razor pages:

1)we have an already built web page which is not dynamic.
2)we can manipulate the code and create website as per our desire.
3)It is comparitively less complex than web Api.

In web Api:

1)There is client which sends a HTTP request and waits for response.
2)There is a model which represents data in an app
3)There is controller which handles HTTP request and response.
4)These are dynamic.
